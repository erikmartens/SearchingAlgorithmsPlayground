//: ## Welcome to the Searching Playground
//:
//: ---
//: > This playground is aimed at programming beginners, who look for a quick crash course about searching. Idealy you will have had a few weeks of coding experience. You already know about primitive data types like **Integers <Int>**, abstract data types such as **arrays**, comparison operators, loops, functions and their [Swift](http://swift.org) syntax. It may help to have understood the general idea behind recursion, but iterative examples will be given alongside, in order to not overwhelm learners who are just starting out. Collections are not typically taught to beginners at the very start, but they are very easy to understand. In order to make some of the examples more interesting, in addition to simple arrays, array type collections will used.
//: >
//: > Some content is labeled with _Advanced_, which should not discourage you. It just means that it goes beyond some of the prerequisites mentioned above. This for example includes import statements, string concatenation, various system functions and more. If you have difficulties understanding any of the stuff, just do a little research to get back into the groove. The philosophy of this playground is to put in a few difficult elements here and there, in order to trigger this type of learning. The learner should feel confident with most of the content and not be overwhelmed. On the other hand it must not be too easy, to keep the boredom away and to provide the chance for self-gratification.

//: ### About this Playground
//:
//: Searching is arguably one of the most commonly used functions in computing. Whether you are looking for a passage within a text document, trying to find files within your operating system or searching the web, a searching algorithm will do the work for you. This playground interactively teaches you about the way these algorithms perform their task. After reading the algorithm's description you can quickly get an understanding of its idea through the provided visualization. Then you can move on to explore the code, tinker with it and see how the bahvior changes.
//:
//: Before diving into the algorithms, let's briefly touch on the idea behind searching. Searching refers to the process of retrieving information from a data structure. Typically searching is performed by going through records of said data structure and comparing them against a key. The simplest form of seaching is called **Linear Search**. It will simply compare every record against the key. Therefore it is very complex (regarding the average amount of key-to-record comparisons required for successful retrieval) and not very efficient. If the records existed in a sorted fashion, faster searching algorithms could be employed. For this reasons sorting algorithms are integral to searching. If you would like to learn more sorting, check out this awesome [Swift Playground](https://github.com/adrfer/Sort.git) by **Adriano Ferreira**.
//:
//: This playground's purpose is to bring newcomers closer to the world of algorithms and the way of thinking behind. Therefore the reader will study two basic searching algorithms. While doing so, basic coding is taught playfully. The course starts out with simple algorithms and then moves on to the more advanced contents gradually. Detailed explanations throughout make it easy to follow and fill in the gaps. Do the course at your own pace and remember masters are made, not born.

//: ### How it works
//:
//: - Get to know the basic idea for the searching algorithms listed below.
//: - See how they are implemented using **Swift**.
//: - Focus on the algorithm iteself: Searching will be performed on **integer arrays**, making comparisons easy. Each **integer** (record) can be directly accessed, using its array index. The key is also an **integer** and of course the same as the one that will be searched for.
//: - Afterwards move on to more advanced implementations and see application examples.

//: ### Why learn about Searching?
//:
//: Searching for data is one of the integral problems in computing. Today end-users take this functionality for granted. However building it can be quite complex. With simple examples the basic ideas is easy to understand though. This makes it a suitaible topic for beginners and helps to fuel the enthusiasm for studying, as well as for building awesome algorithms yourself. Afterall this renders computer science very approachable. Anyone can get into coding, all it takes is a great teacher/mentor.
